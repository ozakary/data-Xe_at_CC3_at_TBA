Diagrammatic representation of the transferability tests workflow, including (\textit{i}) building the initial Xe@TBA configuration, (\textit{ii}) performing the second round of SEMD simulations (SEMD-2) and sampling snapshots, (\textit{iii}) performing single-point DFT calculations on the sampled snapshots to compute $E$, $\Vec{f}$, and $\boldsymbol{s}$, which, together with the snapshots, constitute the transferability dataset (DFT-3), (\textit{iv}) computing $E$, $\Vec{f}$, and $\boldsymbol{s}$ using MLIP-2, (\textit{v})-(\textit{vi}) using the initial Xe@TBA configuration and MLIP-2 to perform the second round of MLMD (MLMD-2), and (\textit{vii}) running \textit{Ab Initio} MD (AIMD) simulation.
