Diagrammatic representation of the NMR machine learning (NMR-ML) model, which include (\textit{i}) running the third round of MLMD simulations (MLMD-3a to 3d) using MLIP-2 and sample snapshots, (\textit{ii}) computing the $^{129}$Xe magnetic shielding tensor ($\boldsymbol{\sigma}$) for these snapshots (DFT-4), and (\textit{iii}) training a second EGNN model (EGNN-2) on the $^{129}$Xe $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ values to obtain the NMR-ML model.
