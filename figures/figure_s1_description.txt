Diagrammatic representation of the machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) workflow, which include (\textit{i}) building the initial configuration, (\textit{ii}) performing semi-empirical molecular dynamics (SEMD) simulations and sample snapshots, (\textit{iii}) carrying out the first round of single-point density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the sampled snapshots to obtain total energies ($E$, eV), atomic forces ($\Vec{f}$, eV.$\text{\AA}^{-1}$), and stress tensors ($\boldsymbol{s}$, eV.$\text{\AA}^{-3}$), which, together with the snapshots, constitute the first dataset (DFT-1), (\textit{iv}) using DFT-1 dataset to train the local E(3)-equivariant graph neural network (EGNN-1) and obtain the first-generation MLIP (MLIP-1), (\textit{v}) using MLIP-1 to perform the first round of machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD-1) simulations and sample snapshots, (\textit{vi}) performing the second round of single-point DFT calculations on the MLMD-1 snapshots to obtain $E$, $\Vec{f}$, and $\boldsymbol{s}$, and merge these data with DFT-1 dataset to build the second dataset (DFT-2), and (\textit{vii}) retraining EGNN-1 on DFT-2 dataset to obtain the second-generation MLIP (MLIP-2).
