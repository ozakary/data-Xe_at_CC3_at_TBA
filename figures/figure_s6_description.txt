Correlation plots of the ML-predicted (DFT-computed) (a) $E_{\text{ML}}$ ($E_{\text{DFT}}$), (b) $\Vec{f}_{\text{ML}}$ ($\Vec{f}_{\text{DFT}}$), and (c) $\boldsymbol{s}_{\text{ML}}$ ($\boldsymbol{s}_{\text{DFT}}$), from the testing dataset of Xe@TBA at RT. The dashed line along the diagonal corresponds to $x=y$, while the solid line represents the linear least-squares regression fit. For each plot, the R-squared, RMSE, and MAE values are given in the upper left corner. Histograms along the axes show the projected distributions of ML-predicted and DFT-computed values from the testing dataset.
