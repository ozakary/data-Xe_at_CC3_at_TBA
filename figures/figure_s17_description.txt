Evolution of the displacement of Xe from the center of mass (CM) of the CC3 cage ($\Delta_{\text{Xe-CM\{CC3\}}}$, $\text{\AA}$) and $^{129}$Xe isotropic chemical shift ($\delta_{\text{iso}}$, ppm) as a function of time ($t$, ps) for each of the eight CC3 cages in Xe@CC3@TBA. In each plot, the y-axis is divided into three patterned regions: C (dotted), D ($///$), and S ($|||$) sites. Raw and filtered data are shown as semi-transparent and opaque lines, respectively. The two Xe atoms near each of the eight cages are labeled Xe@CC3@t$_{0}$ (teal) and Xe@Door@t$_{0}$ (orange), with $t_{0}$ referring to their initial locations. Exchange events, where the two Xe atoms swap sites, are indicated by red arrows. Black arrows link each plot to its corresponding CC3 cages in the perspective view of Xe@CC3@TBA structure (center).
