Evolution of $\Delta_{\text{Xe-CM\{CC3\}}}$ and $^{129}$Xe $\delta_{iso}$ as a function of time (a) for the CC3 cage highlighted in red in the perspective view of Xe@CC3@TBA structure (b). In both plots, the y-axis is divided into three patterned regions where Xe is at the CC3 cage (dotted), the CC3 cage openings or "\textit{doors}" ($///$), and the TBA solvent ($|||$). Raw and filtered data are shown as semi-transparent and opaque lines, respectively. The two Xe atoms near the cage are labeled Xe@CC3@t$_{0}$ (teal) and Xe@Door@t$_{0}$ (orange), with $t_{0}$ referring to their initial locations. Exchange events, where the two Xe atoms swap sites, are indicated by red arrows. Histograms showing the probability density distribution of $^{129}$Xe $\delta_{iso}$ for instances where Xe occupies C (teal), or D (orange), or S (light orange) sites, obtained from combined statistics across all CC3 cages in Xe@CC3@TBA MD trajectory (c). Distribution of $^{129}$Xe $\delta_{iso}$ for the three binding sites, with the box plots show median (red line), interquartile range (IQR, box height), data range within 1.5$\times$IQR (whiskers), and outliers (individual points) (d).
