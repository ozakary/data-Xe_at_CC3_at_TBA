PCA of DFT-4 dataset in (PC1, PC2) based on structure-averaged SOAP descriptors (a). t-SNE of 3$\times$10$^{4}$ randomly sampled individual atomic neighborhoods from the DFT-4 dataset using Cartesian (b) and SOAP (c) representations, with points colored by atomic species. Correlation plot of the ML-predicted (DFT-computed) $\sigma^{\text{ML}}_{\text{iso}}$ ($\sigma^{\text{DFT}}_{\text{iso}}$) (d), from the testing set of the DFT-4 dataset. The dashed line along the diagonal corresponds to $x=y$, while the solid line represents the linear least-squares regression fit. For each plot, the R-squared, RMSE, and MAE values are given in the upper left corner. Histograms along the axes show the projected distributions of ML-predicted and DFT-computed values from the testing dataset.
