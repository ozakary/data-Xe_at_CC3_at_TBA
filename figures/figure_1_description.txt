PCA of DFT-2 dataset in the first two principal components (PC1, PC2) based on structure-averaged SOAP descriptors (a). t-SNE of 3$\times$10$^{4}$ randomly sampled individual atomic neighborhoods from the DFT-2 datasets using Cartesian (b) and SOAP (c) representations, with points colored by atomic species. Correlation plots of the ML-predicted (DFT-computed) $E_{\text{ML}}$ ($E_{\text{DFT}}$) (d), $\Vec{f}_{\text{ML}}$ ($\Vec{f}_{\text{DFT}}$) (e), and $\boldsymbol{s}_{\text{ML}}$ ($\boldsymbol{s}_{\text{DFT}}$) (f), from the testing set of the DFT-2 dataset. The dashed line along the diagonal corresponds to $x=y$, while the solid line represents the linear least-squares regression fit. For each plot, the R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) values are given in the upper left corner. Histograms along the axes show the projected distributions of ML-predicted and DFT-computed values from the testing dataset. (PC1, PC2) (g) and t-SNE using Cartesian (h) and SOAP (i) representations, from DFT-3 dataset, with points colored by atomic species. Total radial distribution function, $g$($r$), as a function of the interatomic distance, $r$, from AIMD (dark blue) and MLMD-2 (orange) simulation trajectories. The difference between the two curves, $\Delta g(r)$, is shown below in gray. The reliability factor, $R_{f}$, quantifying the agreement between the two curves, is reported. An inset in the upper right corner highlights the region $0.8\text{\AA} \leq r\leq 1.6\text{\AA}$.
