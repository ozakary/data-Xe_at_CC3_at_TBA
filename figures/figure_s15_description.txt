Diagrammatic representation of the production simulations, which include (\textit{i}) using MLIP-2 to run the fourth round, production run, MLMD simulations (MLMD-4) and sample snapshots for Xe@TBA, (\textit{ii}) compute $^{129}$Xe $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ with the NMR-ML model for the sampled MLMD-4 snapshots, (\textit{iii}) using MLIP-2 to run the fifth round, production run, MLMD simulations (MLMD-5) and sample snapshots for Xe@CC3@TBA, (\textit{iv}) compute $^{129}$Xe $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$ with the NMR-ML model for the sampled MLMD-5 snapshots, and (\textit{v}) compute $\Delta_{\text{Xe-CM}\{\text{CC3}\}}$ for the sampled MLMD-5 snapshots.
