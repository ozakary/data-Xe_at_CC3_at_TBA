Correlation plots of the ML-predicted (DFT-computed) atomic force components (a) $f_{x}^{\text{ML}}$ ($f_{x}^{\text{DFT}}$), (b) $f_{y}^{\text{ML}}$ ($f_{y}^{\text{DFT}}$), and (c) $f_{z}^{\text{ML}}$ ($f_{z}^{\text{DFT}}$), from the testing dataset of Xe@TBA at 600 K. The dashed line along the diagonal corresponds to $x=y$, while the solid line represents the linear least-squares regression fit. For each plot, the R-squared, RMSE, and MAE values are given in the upper left corner. Histograms along the axes show the projected distributions of ML-predicted and DFT-computed values from the testing dataset.
